							<h2 class=" ">Dream of the Drawing for Everything reveals the alchemy between one thing (image) and another (word); leading to a deeper relationship with the oneiric and apparent reality. This project is envisioned as a map to concentric worlds of perception; offering mundane and lofty realms as guideposts to negotiate the unseen terrains. 						
							</h2>
							<h2>
							Dream of the Drawing for Everything is some of the collaboration between artist Nuala Clarke & writer Crystal Gandrud. Our work arises out of what dances on the edges of perception and our collective attention gravitates to the dream-like nature of human experience.				
							</h2>
							<h3>
							Nuala Clarke and Crystal Gandrud have been in collaboration since 2010. Their merged practices of visual and textual art unfold on a continuum, as part of an interconnected series evolving over time. Both performed “Fair Shouldered One” (a book which is not a book) at the &amp;Now Literary Festival in Paris, 2012 and installed “Between Spaces”, a Yeats inspired dreamscape at the Hamilton Gallery, Sligo, 2013.
